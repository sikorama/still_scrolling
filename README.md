## Additional Credits
* Colors by Barjack/Praline

* Decruncher by Roudoudou & Madram
* Audio Player by Targhan (Arkos Tracker)
* Some Code Tricks by Madram, Offset, Ast

#Â Notes

* Doesn't work on CRTC1 and CRTC2, because of the border trick mixed with ruptures.
* Some parts of Arkos player were removed as some effects were not used by the sound track
* 4KB on Amstrad CPC must take account of AMSDOS Header (12B bytes), so techincally, this is a 3968 bytes intro!
